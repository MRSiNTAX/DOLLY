DOLLY: A VOICE-ACTIVATED AND GESTURE-RECOGNIZING SMART TRASHCAN UTILIZING THE YOLO ALGORITHM FOR AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION
Overview
DOLLY is a smart trashcan designed to improve waste disposal accessibility by integrating voice activation and gesture recognition. The system utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection, enabling it to recognize a 'thumbs-up' gesture and navigate autonomously towards the user. This project aims to assist individuals with mobility impairments and enhance waste management efficiency.
